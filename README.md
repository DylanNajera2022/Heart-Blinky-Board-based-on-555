# Heart-Blinky-Board-based-on-555
This is a small project, just to practice making PCBs a bit more. I did this in a very short time, less than two hours. I really enjoyed doing it because I'd seen kits that sold everything ready for you to solder, but it felt more special to do it from scratch.Here are some photos of the schematic and the finished PCB:
